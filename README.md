## Running 

## TO DO:  

1. Implement system with three algorithms : 
* (1) Preemptive Shortest-Job-First (SJF) Scheduling Algorithm, when the Arrival Time, and Burst Time are given for each process;

* (2) Round Robin (RR) Scheduling Algorithm. when the Arrival Time, Burst Time, and Time Quantum are given for each process;

* (3) Combined Round-Robin and Priority Scheduling Algorithm, when the Arrival Time, Burst Time, Time Quantum, and Process Priority are given for each process.

2. Compile all the test output to the text file ```test_output```
